# Pour
A simple app guiding you to making the perfect pourover

Phase 1 (MVP):
- ~Create a minimal ViewModel with appropriate databinding~
- ~Create a minimal UI for displaying key value and testing step-through behavior~
- Polish the UI substituting animations for timers
- Halt the overall timer on completion of last pour

Phase 2 (Configuration):
- Sketch out an interaction model for choosing/adjusting pourover formulas.
  - Maybe develop a method for creating your own formula
- Create a JSON parser and Provider for feeding in different pourover instructions
